Broadcom MSPI controller

The Broadcom MSPI controller is a SPI master found on various chips, including
BRCMSTB (BCM7XXX) and Cygnus.

Required properties:

- #address-cells:
    Must be <1>, as required by generic SPI binding.

- #size-cells:
    Must be <0>, also as required by generic SPI binding.

- compatible:
    Must be "brcm,spi-brcmstb-mspi" or "brcm,spi-brcmstb".

- reg:
    Define the bases and ranges of the associated I/O address spaces.
    For historical reasons, the first range should contain the MSPI controller
    registers, while the others may be for extended interrupt control or an
    optional Boot SPI (BSPI) portion for accelerating flash reads.  Only
    the MSPI controller register range is required.

- reg-names:
    First name does not matter, but must be reserved for the MSPI controller
    register range as mentioned in 'reg' above, and will typically contain
    "mspi" or "hif_mspi".
    Other names include:
    - "bspi": BSPI register range
    - "bspi_raf": Linear read BSPI pipe register range

- interrupts + interrupt-parent OR interrupts-extended:
    The interrupts used by the MSPI controller.

- interrupt-names:
    Names of interrupts associated with this MSPI controller.
    - "mspi_done": Indicates that the requested SPI operation is complete.

Optional properties:

- clocks:
    A phandle to the reference clock for this block.  If not present, will
    assume a 27 MHz fixed clock (default for UPG).
