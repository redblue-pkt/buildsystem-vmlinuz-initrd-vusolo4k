* Broadcom BCM7xxx Ethernet Controller (GENET)

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "brcm,genet-v1", "brcm,genet-v2", "brcm,genet-v3",
  "brcm,genet-v4".
- reg: address and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: interrupt for the device
- mdio bus node: this node should always be present regarless of the PHY
  configuration of the GENET instance
- phy-mode: The interface between the SoC and the PHY (a string that
  of_get_phy_mode() can understand).

MDIO bus node required properties:

- compatible: should be "brcm,genet-v<N>-mdio"
- reg: address and length relative to the parent node base register address
- address-cells: address cell for MDIO bus addressing, should be 1
- size-cells: size of the cells for MDIO bus addressing, should be 0

Optional properties:
- phy-handle: A phandle to a phy node defining the PHY address (as the reg
  property, a single integer), used to describe configurations where a PHY
  (internal or external) is used.

- fixed-link: When the GENET interface is connected to a MoCA hardware block
  or when operating in a RGMII to RGMII type of connection, or when the
  MDIO bus is voluntarily disabled, this property should be used to describe
  the "fixed link", the property is described as follows:

  fixed-link: <a b c d e> where a is emulated phy id - choose any,
  but unique to the all specified fixed-links, b is duplex - 0 half,
  1 full, c is link speed - d#10/d#100/d#1000, d is pause - 0 no
  pause, 1 pause, e is asym_pause - 0 no asym_pause, 1 asym_pause.

- clocks: When provided, must be two phandles to the functional clock nodes
  of the GENET block. The first phandle is the main GENET clock used during
  normal operation, while the second phandle is the Wake-on-LAN clock.

- clock-names: When provided, names of the functional clock phandles, first
  name should be "sw_genet" and second should be "sw_genetwol".

Internal Gigabit PHY example:

ethernet@f0b60000 {
	phy-mode = "internal";
	phy-handle = <&phy1>;
	mac-address = [ 00 10 18 36 23 1a ];
	compatible = "brcm,genet-v4";
	#address-cells = <0x1>;
	#size-cells = <0x1>;
	device_type = "ethernet";
	reg = <0xf0b60000 0xfc4c>;
	interrupts = <0x0 0x14 0x0 0x0 0x15 0x0>;

	mdio@b60e14 {
		compatible = "brcm,genet-mdio-v4";
		#address-cells = <0x1>;
		#size-cells = <0x0>;
		reg = <0xb60e14 0x8>;

		phy1: ethernet-phy@1 {
			device_type = "ethernet-phy";
			max-speed = <1000>;
			reg = <0x1>;
			compatible = "brcm,28nm-gphy", "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22";
		};
	};
};

MoCA interface / MAC to MAC example:

ethernet@f0b80000 {
	phy-mode = "moca";
	fixed-link = <1 0 1000 0 0>;
	mac-address = [ 00 10 18 36 24 1a ];
	compatible = "brcm,genet-v4";
	#address-cells = <0x1>;
	#size-cells = <0x1>;
	device_type = "ethernet";
	reg = <0xf0b80000 0xfc4c>;
	interrupts = <0x0 0x16 0x0 0x0 0x17 0x0>;

	mdio@b80e14 {
		compatible = "brcm,genet-mdio-v4";
		#address-cells = <0x1>;
		#size-cells = <0x0>;
		reg = <0xb80e14 0x8>;
	};
};


External MDIO-connected Gigabit PHY/switch:

ethernet@f0ba0000 {
	phy-mode = "rgmii";
	phy-handle = <&phy0>;
	mac-address = [ 00 10 18 36 26 1a ];
	compatible = "brcm,genet-v4";
	#address-cells = <0x1>;
	#size-cells = <0x1>;
	device_type = "ethernet";
	reg = <0xf0ba0000 0xfc4c>;
	interrupts = <0x0 0x18 0x0 0x0 0x19 0x0>;

	mdio@ba0e14 {
		compatible = "brcm,genet-mdio-v4";
		#address-cells = <0x1>;
		#size-cells = <0x0>;
		reg = <0xba0e14 0x8>;

		phy0: ethernet-phy@0 {
			device_type = "ethernet-phy";
			max-speed = <1000>;
			reg = <0x0>;
			compatible = "brcm,bcm53125", "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22";
		};
	};
};
