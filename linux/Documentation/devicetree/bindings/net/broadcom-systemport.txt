* Broadcom BCM7xxx Ethernet Systemport Controller (SYSTEMPORT)

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of "brcm,systemport-v1.00" or "brcm,systemport"
- reg: address and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: interrupt(s) for the device, 1 interrupt is the RX and misc
  interrupts, the second is the TX queues interrupts. A 3rd optional interupt
  is used for Wake-on-LAN
- local-mac-address: Ethernet MAC address (48 bits) of this adapter
- phy-mode: Should be a string describing the PHY interface to the
  Ethernet switch/PHY
- fixed-link: <a b c d e> where a is emulated phy id - choose any,
  but unique to the all specified fixed-links, b is duplex - 0 half,
  1 full, c is link speed - d#10/d#100/d#1000, d is pause - 0 no
  pause, 1 pause, e is asym_pause - 0 no asym_pause, 1 asym_pause.

Optional properties:
- systemport,num-tier2-arb: number of tier 2 arbiters, an integer
- systemport,num-tier1-arb: number of tier 1 arbiters, an integer
- systemport,num-txq: number of HW transmit queues, an integer
- systemport,num-rxq: number of HW receive queues, an integer

Example:
ethernet@f04a0000 {
	compatible = "brcm,systemport-v1.00";
	reg = <0xf04a0000 0x4650>;
	local-mac-address = [ 00 11 22 33 44 55 ];
	fixed-link = <0 1 1000 0 0>;
	phy-mode = "gmii";
	interrupts = <0x0 0x16 0x0>,
		<0x0 0x17 0x0>;
};
