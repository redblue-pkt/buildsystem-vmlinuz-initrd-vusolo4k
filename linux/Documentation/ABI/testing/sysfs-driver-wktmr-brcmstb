Description:	The control file for the wakeup timer. This integer value
		represents the number of seconds between a suspend operation
		(e.g., S3 suspend-to-RAM) and the time at which the wakeup
		timer should fire.

		Values are -1 (default) or any non-negative integer. Units are
		in seconds. The special value of -1 means the timer should not
		wake up the system.
