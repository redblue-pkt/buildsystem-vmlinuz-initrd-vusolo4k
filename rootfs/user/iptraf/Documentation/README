Documentation 2.7 README

***

This directory contains the IPTraf user manual in HTML format.

The IPTraf manual has been redesigned and has now been recoded into
DocBook 4.1 SGML format, and translated into HTML.  It now features 
navigation much like the Linux Documentation Project manuals and HOWTO's.
The main file is manual.html, with the symlink index.html pointing to it.

The SGML template is included but gzipped.  It needs to be gunzipped and
run through the make process for the version numbers to be tacked into the
source.  Running make will generate the final SGML source and the HTML
files.

As of 2.7.0, the manual is now released under the terms of the GNU Free 
Documentation License of March, 2000.

Screenshot images have also been converted to Portable Network Graphics 
(PNG) format.  DocBook icons are included in GIF format under the 
stylesheet-images directory.
