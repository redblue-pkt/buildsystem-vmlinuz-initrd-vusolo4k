INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR IPTRAF 3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: READ THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS SECTION IN THE README.  IPTRAF 2
REQUIRES LINUX 2.2 OR LATER.

To compile and install, just change to the iptraf-3.0.0 top-level directory
and type:

	./Setup

This will automatically compile and install the software.

The traditional

	cd src
	make clean
	make
	make install

can still be used.

Precompiled binaries are available in the iptraf-3.0.0.i386.bin.tar.gz
file.  This contains no source code and is expected to run on Intel x86
Linux with the GNU C Library 2.1 or later.

UPGRADING FROM 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, or 2.7

IPTraf 2.8 has new filter behavior, and filters now contain additional data to
control this behavior.  See the RELEASE-NOTES file for details.

Because the filter subsystem has been completely redesigned, old filters
will no longer work and cannot be upgraded.  Filters will have to be
redefined.

DEALING WITH "ERROR OPENING TERMINAL"

The precompiled executable program comes linked with ncurses 4.2.  ncurses
4.2 needs to determine your terminal capabilities from the terminfo
database in /usr/share/terminfo.  If the supplied program fails with
"Error opening terminal", check this directory.  If it doesn't exist, your
terminfo database may be somewhere else.  To override the default terminfo
search path, you can use the TERMINFO environment variable.  Supposing
your terminfo is in /usr/lib/terminfo (typical for Slackware
distributions)

	TERMINFO=/usr/lib/terminfo
	export TERMINFO

You may want to place these commands in your login initialization files
(/etc/profile or ~/.profile for sh/bash).

You can also create a symbolic link /usr/share/terminfo to point to
your existing terminfo database.  For example, given the same conditions
above:

	ln -s /usr/lib/terminfo /usr/share/terminfo

Or, as an alternative, you can simply recompile your program to use your
ncurses installation.  Be sure you have at least ncurses 1.9.9e.  See
section on recompiling below.

See the README file and the manual for more information.
