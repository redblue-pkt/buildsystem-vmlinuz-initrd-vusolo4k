This package contains the lttd, lttctl and liblttctl programs which are
necessary to obtain a trace. It also contains the facilities directory, where
sits the trace metainformation.

* Compiling

gcc 3.2 or better
glib 2.4 or better development libraries
  (Debian : libglib2.0-0, libglib2.0-dev)
  (Fedora : glib2, glib2-devel)
libc6 development librairies 
  (Debian : libc6, libc6-dev)
  (Fedora : glibc, glibc)


To compile the source tree from a tarball, simply follow these steps :

- ./configure
- make
- make install

After running ./configure, you can also go in specific subdirectories and
use make, make install.


* Quick Start

See the LTTV package QUICKSTART file.


* Source Tree Structure

Here is the tree structure of the ltt-control package.

ltt/		New trace format reading library.
liblttctl/	Library to communicate with the kernel tracer control module.
lttctl/		Command line program to use the liblttctl library.
lttd/		Linux Trace Toolkit daemon.
README		This file.


* For Developers

This source tree is based on the autotools suite from GNU to simplify
portability. Here are some things you should have on your system in order to
compile the subversion repository tree :

- GNU autotools (automake >=1.7, autoconf >=2.50, autoheader >=2.50)
  (make sure your system wide "automake" points to a recent version!)
- GNU Libtool
  (for more information, go to http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)

If you get the tree from the repository, you will need to use the autogen.sh
script. It calls all the GNU tools needed to prepare the tree configuration.
