	* syslogd.c: Fix processing accumulated messages from
	  /proc/kmsg (patch provided by Michael Deutschmann).

2002-09-02  Sergey Poznyakoff 

	* syslogd.c: '**' extension (Michael Deutschmann
	  <michael@talamasca.ocis.net> allows to catch all facilities
	  not specified explicitely in the configuration file.

2002-08-21  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>

	* syslogd.c (main): Fixed memory overrun when writing long
	  data blocks from /proc/kmsg. Thanks to Michael Deutschmann
	  <michael@talamasca.ocis.net>

2002-04-29  Alfred M. Szmidt  <ams@kemisten.nu>

	* syslogd.c <version.h>: Include removed.
	(inetutils_package): Renamed to PACKAGE_NAME.
	(inetutils_version): Renamed to PACKAGE_VERSION.
	(inetutils_bugaddr): Renamed to PACKAGE_BUGREPORT.

2002-04-21  Alfred M. Szmidt <ams@kemisten.nu>

	* Makefile.am (inetdaemon_PROGRAMS): Use syslogd_BUILD instead of
	BUILD_SYSLOGD.

2002-03-05  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (main): New variables KLINE and KLINE_LEN, to store
	partial lines from the kernel log device.  Collect partial lines
	until we either have a maximum partial line or a full line.  Log
	that, and all following lines collected so far, and in the case of
	the maximum partial line skip the remainder of the current line.
	Reported by Davin McCall <davmac@iname.com>.

2002-02-10  Jeff Bailey  <jbailey@outpost.dnsalias.org>

	* Makefile.am: Add -I$(top_builddir)/include to INCLUDES

2001-11-21  Sergey Poznyakoff

	* syslogd.c: Removed redeclaration of hstrerror: it is
	provided in include/config.h when missing.

2001-10-25  Alain Magloire

	* syslogd/syslogd.c:  Use the same code in talkd/talkd.c to handle
	utmp vs utmpx.
	(wallmesg):  Use the macros when manipulating utmp functions.

2001-01-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (usage): Add missing parentheses in help text.

2000-11-25  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (main): Give reason for failure of waitdaemon.
	(add_funix): Print program name and reason for failure in error
	message.

2000-10-30  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c: Remove PROGRAM, declare __PROGNAME.
	Prototype waitdaemon(). Remove COPYRIGHT (it's in the
	comment at the top). Replace "#ifndef lint" with "#if 0"
	for SCCSID to avoid gcc warning.
	(main): Initialize __PROGNAME if not HAVE___PROGNAME.
	Use __PROGNAME instead PROGRAM.
	(usage): Likewise.
	(crunch_list): Likewise.
	(die): Likewise.

2000-08-16  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (usage): If err != 0, print Usage: ... line to stdout.
	Uppercase all sentences.
	(main): Fix indentation in while condition and add a newline after
	a break statement.
	
2000-08-13  Alain Magloire

	* syslogd.c (main): Error in the code the inet file descriptor
	was not initialize correctely.

2000-08-13  Alain Magloire

	* syslogd.c (main):  New variable short_options.
	Removed of reap_child() and SIGCHLD signal handler.
	ttymsg() now double fork() and do itself the waitpid()
	to clean up.
	Remove all those little loops that uses tolower()
	to bring the string to loser case for a comparison
	and use strcasecmp() when comparison are needed.

2000-08-11  Alain Magloire

	* syslogd.c: Include unconditionnaly <utmpx.h> and
	<poll.h>, we (will) provide a stub when the OS is lacking.

2000-08-10  Alain Magloire

	* syslogd.c (wallmsg):  Only check for the type USER_PROCESS
	The others on GNU/Linux generate errors.  And we only need
	to alert legitimate users that are login.
	* syslogd.c : New option '-S, --sync' to behave like GNU/Linux
	syslogd that sync on every line.  Syncing on every lines can
	bring a machine to its knees if an application is trying to
	be malicious.

2000-08-10  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (main): When -d option is given, set NoDetach to 1.
	Only test for !NoDetach when daemonising, and no longer for !Debug.

2000-08-09  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	Fix ChangeLog weirdness.
	* syslogd.c: "New" prototype reap_childs.
	(main): Install SIGCHLD handler.
	(reap_childs): Function back. We do fork for blocking I/O.
	This time use waitpid unconditionally.

2000-08-08  Alain Magloire

	* syslogd.c (dbg_printf): [HAVE_STDARG_H][_STDC__] to
	palliate for OS not having ANSI C.
	[HAVE_UTMPX_H] before including <utmpx.h>.
	(usage): Some of the strings where missing newlines.
	[IOVCNT]: new macro to define the size of the iovec array.
	(fprintlog): Clear the iovec before using it.
	(logmsg): get rid of ugly hardcode and use sizeof (f->f_lastime) - 1
	intead for the len of the f_lastime string.
	(fprintlog): use sizeof(f->lastime) - 1.

2000-08-08  Marcus Brinkmann <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c: Don't prototype reapchild.
	(main): Don't install SIGCHLD handler.
	(reapchild): Function removed. It is cruft needed for
	the linux wallmsg implementation, which we don't useb.

2000-08-06  Alain Magloire

Adding poll() bring to light that we do the creation of sockets
inside init(), this has the unfortunate side effect of close()ing
and  recreating the sockets at every SIGHUP.  This was done to
speedup initialization of syslogd, since on GNU/Linux the rc.*
files would start klogd also.  This is also the reason for a waitdaemon():
"Wed Feb 14 12:42:09 CST 1996:  Dr. Wettstein
Parent process of syslogd does not exit until child process has
finished initialization process.  This allows rc.* startup to
pause until syslogd facility is up and operating."

	* syslogd.c (init): Remove call to creation of sockets
	and move it to the main() before going in the loop.

2000-08-06  Alain Magloire

	* syslogd.c (main): Use of poll() instead of select()
	for better modularity.

2000-08-06  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (add_funix): New function to add new
	unix sockets.

2000-08-06  Alain Magloire

	* syslogd.c (init): Remove restriction of LINE_MAX
	by reallocating the buffer when the line is too long,
	by doing this the continuation line feature was more
	straightforward.  The downfall is dealing with out of
	memory errors.  But the code, so far, does not deal
	with this anywhere.
	(domark): signo ignored.
	(init): signo ignored.
	(dbg_toggle): signo ignored.
	(trigger_restart): signo ignored.
	Remove superfluous initializations of global
	and static variables.

2000-08-05  Alain Magloire

Remove restrictions on options -l, -s, better compliance to GNU
coding rules .i.e no limits in the number of possible open sockets.
Code indenting to conform to GNU style.

	* syslogd.c: Use ``const'' consistenly for readonly
	strings; cfline(), dbg_printf(), logerror(), etc ...
	Prototypes/declarations use ``void'' for consistency.
	Standardise all function definitions, so ansi2knr could
	do its job properly.
	(create_inet_socket): Variable ``on'' unuse.
	(usage): try_help() and help() merge to usage (int).
	usage() is pass an integer and exit(err);
	(main): Remove setlinebuf() use setvbuf() only.
	(main): Regroup unix sockets and fd's into the same
	structure easier to carry. Remove restriction
	on 19 + 1 possible open unix sockets.
	(crunch_list): Take one more argument, the oldlist
	so it can be reallocated for new entries.  This removed
	the restrictions of the number of LocalHosts and StripDomains.

2000-08-05  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (help): --no-forward does not override -r,
	but -h.
	(init): Create inet socket if either AcceptRemote or
	Forwarding is true, but with Forwarding only if not
	--no-forward was provided. This is less restrictive than
	before, where --no-forward would prevent incoming messages
	allowed with -r, which was documented but not intended.
	* syslogd.8: Document (badly) all the new options from
	last change.

2000-08-04  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c: In the whole file, change the formatting
	to conform to the GNU coding standards. Also clean up
	some debug and error messages. All further functional
	changes are listed below.

	Initialize finet and fklog to -1.
	New variables NoKLog, NoUnixAF, NoForward, long_options,
	program_name. New symbols USAGE, TTYMSGTIME.
	(help): New function.
	(try_help): New function.
	(usage): Use try_help.
	(main): Don't initialize finet, fklog here.
	Initialize program_name. Use getopt_long instead getopt.
	Handle option '&' (--help). Handle unknown options with try_help
	and usage. Handle long options 'P' (--pidfile), 'F' (--no-foward),
	'K' (--no-klog), 'U' (--no-unixaf).
	Move initialization of tv into the main loop. select meddles with
	the timeval on some systems (Linux) and we don't want to take any
	risk.
	(init): (Re-) Initialize fklog here if not NoKLog.
	Only open unix sockets if not NoUnixAF. Failing to open
	the primary socket is fatal.
	Only open inet socket if not NoForward.
	(fprintlog): More diagnostic in case F_FORW: Show debug info
	when forwarding is disabled or finet is invalid for other reasons.
	(wallmsg): Use TTYMSGTIME instead hard coded default.
	(cfline): In case '|' fix nasty bug in if clause.

2000-08-03  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (waitdaemon): Removed.
	(timedout): Removed.

2000-08-03  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c: If HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H, include <sys/types> for pid_t.
	New global variable fklog.
	(main): Fix comment. Remove local variables fklog, sunx, sin.
	(die): Close fklog if open.
	(waitdaemon): Ansify.
	(timedout): Likewise. Drop __unused attribute.

2000-08-03  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (waitdaemon, timedout): New prototype and functions
	from FreeBSD syslogd (rev 1.66).
	(main): Remove conditional MSG_BSIZE on line variable.
	New variables tv, tvp, ppid.
	Call waitdaemon instead daemon to fork into background.
	Before main loop, initialize tv and tvp to zero.
	In main loop, pass tvp to select. This will make syslogd return
	immediately until we set tvp to NULL.
	Check return value of select. If it is zero (no messages),
	and tvp is not NULL, set it to NULL and send parent a SIGALRM.
	This will be its signal to terminate.

2000-08-03  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c: Include <stdarg.h>.
	(struct msg_part): Fix type declaration.
	(main): Rename variable c to l.
	Initialize all of funix, finet to -1.
	Remove dangling closing brace.
	Main loop: Declare variable nfds.
	Pass argument to init.
	Add missing parentheses to if-clause.
	Back out from using printchopped in unix and inet socket handling,
	not only because it doesn't work, but also because it is utterly
	nonsense without the S_STREAM patch.
	(make_part): Add missing brace.
	(die): Add missing variable i.

2000-08-03  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This covers the following Linux changes:
Thu Jan  6 12:07:36 CST 1994:  Dr. Wettstein
Also thanks to Juha for a patch to exclude users with a class
of LOGIN from receiving messages.
Mon Oct 12 20:22:59 CEST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
Added support for setutent()/getutent()/endutend() instead of
binary reading the UTMP file.  This is the the most portable
way.  This allows /var/run/utmp format to change, even to a
real database or utmp daemon. Also if utmp file locking is
implemented in libc, syslog will use it immediately.  Thanks
to Topi Miettinen <tom@medialab.sonera.net>.

	* syslogd.c: Include <utmpx.h> instead <utmp.h>.
	(wallmsg): Use pointer to struct utmpx, not struct utmp.
	Fix the size of line accoridngly.
	Use setutxent instead opening the utmp file ourself.
	Use getutxent instead fread.
	Don't log to ut_type LOGIN_PROCESS, and don't log to
	ut_user LOGIN (paranoia check).
	Use ut_user instead ut_name.
	Use endutxent instead fclose.

2000-08-02  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This is among others the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Thu Jan  6 12:07:36 CST 1994:  Dr. Wettstein
Added support for proper decomposition and re-assembly of
fragment messages on UNIX domain sockets.  Lack of this capability
was causing 'partial' messages to be output.  Since facility and
priority information is encoded as a leader on the messages this
was causing lines to be placed in erroneous files.

	* syslogd.c: New symbol INITIAL_PARTS.
	New struct msg_part, new global variables parts, nparts.
	(get_part): New prototype, new function.
	(free_part): Likewise.
	(make_part): Likewise.
	(printchopped): Likewise.
	(main): New variable c. Allocate initial parts table
	after installing signal handlers. In main loop,
	use c instead i to count through funices. If a read
	from a unx domain socket returns 0, close this fd.
	Use printchopped instead printline to support partial
	messages (a bit messy though).

2000-08-02  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c: Remove global variable InetInuse.
	(main): Check finet instead InetInuse.
	(fprintlog): Case F_FORW: Only try to forward message
	when finet is valid.
	(die): Check finet instead InetInuse.
	(init): Don't fiddle InetInuse.
	(cfline): Case '@': Don't check InetInuse (instead we
	check finet in fprintlog, see above).

2000-08-02  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	Merged from the Linux source (sysklogd 1.3):
	* syslogd.c: New global variable restart.
	(main): Main loop: If restart is set, call init()
	and reset restart.
	Install sighup_handler as SIGHUP handler.
	(sighup_handler): New prototype, new function.

2000-08-02  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

I think this is among others the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon Feb 23 23:32:35 CET 1998: Topi Miettinen <Topi.Miettinen@ml.tele.fi>
Re-worked handling of Unix and UDP sockets to support closing /
opening of them in order to have it open only if it is needed
either for forwarding to a remote host or by receiption from
the network.

	* syslogd.c (FDMASK): Removed.
	(create_unix_socket): New prototype, new function.
	(create_inet_socket): Likewise.
	(main): Remove variables funix, inetm, klogm.
	Move SUN_LEN and creation of unix domaim sockets/inet socket
	to create_*_socket and init().
	When opening PATH_KLOG, use fklog to store result.
	Main loop: Rediddle code to use a fd_set and FD_*
	operations instead an int and bit operations.
	New variable maxfds to store highest fd.
	Check fklog before checking fklog fd bit.
	Check InetInuse before checking inet fd bit.
	Clear buffer line before reading inet message.
	(die): Close inet socket.
	(init): New variable Forwarding and sp.
	Check here for service syslog/udp instead in main.
	Set Forwarding when appropriate (one of F_FORW* types).
	Looping over funix here, closing and (re)opening unix
	sockets using create_unix_socket.
	Closing and opening inet socet as appropriate.

2000-08-02  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon Oct 12 14:02:51 CEST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
Applied patch provided vom Topi Miettinen with regard to the
people from OpenBSD.  This provides the additional '-a'
argument used for specifying additional UNIX domain sockets to
listen to.  This is been used with chroot()'ed named's for
example.  See for http://www.psionic.com/papers/dns.html

	* Note: The above link is actually ".../papers/dns/".
	* syslogd.c (LogName): Remove global variable.
	(nfunix, funixn, funix): New global variables.
	(MAXFUNIX): New symbol.
	(main): Add option '-a' to getopt() invocation.
	Learn the alphabet.
	Add '-a' option processing.
	Convert '-p' option to funixn.
	Don't unlink LogName (doesn't exist anymore).
	Create nfunix unix sockets in funix (using funixn)
	(also unlink funixn here).
	Main loop: Diddle the readfds initialization a bit.
	Initialize nfds on the way.
	Loop over all funix sockets and add their descriptors.
	In select call, use nfds+1 and not arbitrary 20.
	Later, check all funix for available reads.
	(usage): Document '-a' option.
	(die): Don't unlink LogName, instead close and unlink
	all unix sockets in funix.

2000-08-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon Oct 12 20:49:18 MET DST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
Avoid logging of SIGCHLD when syslogd is in the process of
exiting and closing its files.  Again thanks to Topi.

	* syslogd.c (init): New variable was_initialized.
	Set Initialize to 0 temporarily to avoid logging of SIGCHLD.

2000-08-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (main): Really fix getopt argument this time.
	Break after acting on option '-n'.
	(crunch_list): Remove semicolon that makes a prototype from
	the implementation (doh!).

2000-08-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (usage): Beautify with package name and version number.

2000-08-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (cvthname): Fix some really stupid errors in last change.

2000-08-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (domark): Don't log mark if MarkInterval is <= 0.
	* syslogd.8 (SYNOPSIS): Add '-l', '-r', '-n' and '-s' (oops).
	Document behaviour of '-m 0'.

2000-08-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c: Fix prototype of debug_switch.
	(cfline): In case '|', check for terminal and console.
	In case '/', rearrange this very check.
	(debug_switch): Fix parameter list to match prototype.
	Don't install signal handler here.

	* syslogd.c (repeatinterval): Shorten from 30, 120, 600
	to 30, 60. This is what Linux sysklogd 1.3 uses.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon Feb 10 00:09:11 MET DST 1997:  Martin Schulze
Improved debug code to decode the numeric facility/priority
pair into textual information.

	* syslogd.c (textpri): New prototype and function.
	(logmsg): Use textpri in log message.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (cfline): Instead number 0 use char '\0'.
	Make debug output nicer by better alignment.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (init): Replace hard coded "/dev/console"
	by PATH_CONSOLE.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (cfline): Fix off-by-one error. We have to
	take into account "LOG_MARK" which has facility number
	LOG_NFACILITIES.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (main): Add "-s" option to getopt invocation.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This is based on the equivalent Linux change:
Thu Oct 19 00:02:07 MET 1995:  Martin Schulze
The default behavior has changed for security reasons. The
syslogd will not receive any remote message unless you turn
reception on with the "-r" option.

	* syslogd.c (AllowRemote): New global variable.
	(main): New option "-r" to set AllowRemote.
	Only if AllowRemote is true add inetm to readfds
	and check for messages from there.
	(usage): Document new option "-r".
	(init): In start-up message, show if we allow remote messages.
	* syslogd.8: Document new option "-r".

	(init): In start-up message, show package name and version
	number (like: "GNU inetutils 1.3.2c").

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

This is the equivalent to the following Linux changes:
Wed Nov 22 22:32:55 1995:  Martin Schulze
Added the fabulous strip-domain feature that allows us to
strip off (several) domain names from the fqdn and only log
the simple hostname. This is useful if you're in a LAN that
has a central log server and also different domains.

I have also also added the -l switch do define hosts as
local. These will get logged with their simple hostname, too.

	* syslogd.c (LIST_DELIMITER): New symbol.
	(StripDomains, LocalHosts): New variables.
	(crunch_list): New prototype and function.
	(main): New options "-s" and "-l".
	(usage): Document "-s" and "-l".
	(cvthname): Use StripDomains and LocalHosts to frob
	the hostname before returning.
	* syslogd.8: Document new options "-s" and "-l".

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	Merged from the Linux source (sysklogd 1.3):
	* syslogd.c (debugging_on): New global variable to toggle debug output.
	(debug_switch, dprintf): New prototypes, new functions. Redefine dprintf
	to mydprintf when __GLIBC__ is defined.
	Remove macro for dprintf.
	(main): Set debugging_on to true early, and to false again before
	entering main loop. Install debug_switch as SIGUSR1 handler.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	Merged from the Linux source (sysklogd 1.3):
	* syslogd.c (F_FORW_SUSP): New symbol.
	(F_FORW_UNKN, F_PIPE): Increment value, to make space for F_FORW_SUSP.
	(TypeNames): Insert name for F_FORW_SUSP.
	(fprintlog): Add case for F_FORW_SUSP.
	In case F_FORW use F_FORW_SUSP on error (and not F_FORW_UNKN).
	Add debug message.
	(init): Handle case F_FORW_SUSP in debug output like F_FORW.

2000-07-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* syslogd.c (NoDetach): New global variable.
	(main): New option "-n". If NoDetach is true, don't
	background and detach from controlling terminal.
	(usage): Document new option n.
	* syslogd.8: Document new option "-n".

2000-07-05 Alain Magloire

	*: Clause 3 removed.
	excerpt from email with RMS:
	"UCB has agreed to drop the advertising clause from the license for all
	BSD software.  The advertising clause is this one:

	3.All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software

1999-10-01  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

	* syslogd.c (main): Type of len changed from int to size_t.
	(usage): Add -V option, make output consistent with other GNU tools.

	* syslogd.8: Document "-V" option.

	* syslogd.c (logmsg): Only accept priority if the exact bit
	is set (instead of an inequality).
	(cfline): negate_pri, excl_pri, pri_set, pri_clear: New variables.
	Allow '!' and '=' prepended to priority specification to exclude
	these resp. higher priorities.

	* syslogd.c (printline): Add SYNC_FILE to logmsg
	invocation for more reliability.
	(struct filed): New member f_flags to hold new macro OMIT_SYNC.
	(logmsg): Only fsync if OMIT_SYNC is not set.

	Set OMIT_SYNC in f_flags if action is prepended by `-' in
	the conf file.

	* syslog.conf.5: Document level modifiers '!' and '='.
	Add `-' rule.

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:

Wed Feb 14 12:42:09 CST 1996:  Dr. Wettstein
Allowed forwarding of messages received from remote hosts to
be controlled by a command-line switch.  Specifying -h allows
forwarding.  The default behavior is to disable forwarding of
messages which were received from a remote host.

	* syslogd.c: New global variable "NoHops".
	(main): New option "-h" to clear NoHops.
	(usage): Document new "-h" option.
	(fprintlog): New argument (char *) from.
	If from != LocalHostName and NoHops set, don't forward
	message.
	(logmsg): Add from argument to fprintlog invocation.
	(domark): Likewise.
	(die): Likewise.
	(init): Likewise.

	* syslogd.8: Document new "-h" option.

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Wed Jul 26 18:57:23 MET DST 1995:  Martin Schulze
The 'LocalDomain' and the hostname of a remote machine is
converted to lower case, because the original caused some
inconsistency, because the (at least my) nameserver did respond an
fqdn containing of upper- _and_ lowercase letters while
'LocalDomain' consisted only of lowercase letters and that didn't
match.

	* syslogd.c (main): Try harder to get the FQDN of
	localhost and convert LocalDomain to lowercase. (This should
	probably be in libinetutils).
	(cvthname): Add "." to output strings.
	Convert hostname to lowercase before comparing with LocalDomain.

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Tue May 28 00:58:45 MET DST 1996:  Martin Schulze
Corrected behaviour of blocking pipes - i.e. the whole system
hung.  Michael Nonweiler <mrn20@hermes.cam.ac.uk> has sent us
a patch to correct this.  A new logfile type F_PIPE has been
introduced.

	* syslogd.c: New macro F_PIPE.
	(TypeNames): New logfile type PIPE.
	(fprintlog): Support for F_PIPE added.
	(init): Likewise.
	(cfline): Likewise, use '|' in conf file.
	(cfline): Open log files with O_CREAT and
	permission 0644.

	* syslog.conf.5: Add documentation for new logfile type PIPE.

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon May 20 13:29:32 MET DST 1996:  Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>
Added continuation line support.

	* syslogd.c (init): Add support for continuated lines
          (implemented by Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>).

	* syslog.conf.5: Mention continuated line feature.

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon Aug 21 22:10:35 MET DST 1995:  Martin Schulze
Corrected a strange behavior during parsing of configuration
file. The original BSD syslogd doesn't understand spaces as
separators between specifier and action. This syslogd now
understands them. The old behavior caused some confusion over
the Linux community.

	* syslogd.c (cfline): Allow space as delimiter.

	* syslog.conf.5: Seperator can now be a space, too.

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Thu Oct 26 13:14:06 MET 1995:  Martin Schulze
Added another logfile type F_FORW_UNKN.  The problem I ran into
was a name server that runs on my machine and a forwarder of
kern.crit to another host.  The hosts address can only be
fetched using the nameserver.  But named is started after
syslogd, so syslogd complained.
This logfile type will retry to get the address of the
hostname ten times and then complain.  This should be enough to
get the named up and running during boot sequence.
Sat Jan 10 01:33:06 CET 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
Fixed small bugs in F_FORW_UNKN meachanism.  Thanks to Torsten
Neumann <torsten@londo.rhein-main.de> for pointing me to it.

	* syslogd.c: INET_SUSPEND_TIME, INET_RETRY_MAX,
	F_FORW_UNKN: New macros.
	TypeNames: Add "FORW(UNKNOWN)". If gethostbyname fails for some host,
	this type will retry INET_RETRY_TIMES times before it finally fails.
	(fprintlog): New variable hp. Move clearing f_time inside every
	case it is appropriate for. Add new case F_FORW_UNKN. New goto
	target f_forw. Only clear f_prevcount if appropriate.
	(init): Do not close f_file for F_FORW. Add debug output for
	F_FORW_UNKN.
	(cfline): If gethostbyname fails, set f_type to F_FORW_UNKN instead
	giving up instantly.

1999-06-08  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (MAXSVLINE): Increase number.
	(cfline): Double size of ebuf.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (decode): Double buffer size.

199-08-07  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (usage): Add -V option,
	make output consistent with other GNU tools.

This is the equivalent to the following Linux change:
Mon Oct 12 22:18:34 CEST 1998: Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>
Modified printline() to support 8bit characters - such as
russion letters.  Thanks to Vladas Lapinskas <lapinskas@mail.iae.lt>.

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (printline): Make eight bit clean for our
	friends in Russia (and other).

1999-06-08  Marcus Brinkmann  <brinkmd@debian.org>

	* syslogd/syslogd.c (fprintlog): Use snprintf instead of sprintf.
	* syslogd/syslogd.c: Fixed typo in comment.
	* syslogd/syslogd.c: Include <version.h>.
	(main): Add option -V (version).
