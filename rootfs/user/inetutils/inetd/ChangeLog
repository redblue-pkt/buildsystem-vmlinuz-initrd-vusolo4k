	* inetd.c: Fixed memory overrun in main.

	The idea is to provide an easy way to add services without
	mocking around with inetd.conf.  It is possible to just
	drop a file in PATH_INETDDIR, and the file will be pick
	and merge like if it was a configuration file.  For example,

	/etc/inetd.d/telnet
	/etc/inetd.d/ftp
	/etc/inetd.d/login
	/etc/inetd.d/shell

	will contain the entries to start telnet/ftp/rlogin/shell
	without having to put them in /etc/inetd.conf.
	The idea was submitted by Jakob.

	The code had a face lift to comply with GNU coding style.

	* inetd.c: prototypes changes:
	void  endconfig __P((FILE *));
	struct servtab *getconfigent __P((FILE *, const char *));
	char  *newstr __P((const char *));
	void  nextconfig __P((const char *));
	void print_service __P((const char *, const char *, struct servtab *));
	FILE           *setconfig __P((const char *));
	char          *sskip __P((char **, FILE *, const char *));
	char          *skip __P((char **, FILE *));
	(usage): Updated.
	(main): Localised the variables.
	Read the line configuration files in to an array.
	(config):  Go through the configuration files arrays and
	call nextconfig on each file for parsing.
	(nextconfig): Parse the configuration file and construct
	an service entry.

	* inetd.8: Update to document the new PATH_INETDDIR feature.

2000-10-31  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* inetd.c: Remove COPYRIGHT (it's in the header)
	and "#if 0"-out SCCSID.
	Declare __PROGNAME.
	New variables SHORT_OPTIONS and LONG_OPTIONS.
	(main): Initialize __progname if not HAVE___PROGNAME.
	Rename CH to OPTION. Rework option parsing to use getopt_long.
	(usage): Completely new and conforming to the others.

2000-10-30  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* inetd.c: Include <grp.h> for initgroups().

2000-07-18 Alain Magloire

	* inetd.c(main): Check for SIGPIPE too.
	* inetd.c(run_service): New function, This the same code when
	fork()ing in main(), but it put here so it could be reuse for tcpmux.
	* inetd.c(tcpmux): better support and change of prototype.

2000-07-05 Alain Magloire

	* *: Clause 3 removed.
