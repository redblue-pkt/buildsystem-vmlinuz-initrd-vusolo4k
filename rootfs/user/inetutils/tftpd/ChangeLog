	* *: Clause 3 removed.
	excerpt from email with RMS:
	"UCB has agreed to drop the advertising clause from the license for all
	BSD software.  The advertising clause is this one:

	3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software
		must display the following acknowledgement:
		This product includes software developed by the University of
		California, Berkeley and its contributors.

	This means that we can delete that paragraph from all files which give
	the University of California as the only copyright holder."

	* It has to do with handling of files with more than 32766 blocks. The
	TFTP packets should be able to handle up to 65535 blocks. But many
	tftpd's seem to treat the block# as a short instead of an unsigned
	short. This appears to be caused by the arpa/tftp.h header declaring it
	as a short. The relevant RFC's do not indicate that this is supposed to
	be the case.
	Patch and Email exchange from Nathan Neulinger.
