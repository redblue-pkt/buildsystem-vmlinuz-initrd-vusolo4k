	Unfortunately some platforms, like QNX/Neutrino does not implement flow
	control packet mode TIOCPKT.  If it is not defined, provide the
	constant. It should not affect the functionnality, but the server
	will not be able to process CTRL-Q CTRL-S.

	* rlogin/rlogin.c: Define the  macros TIOCPKT_XXX.
	(speed_translate): This did not work on QNX/Neutrino, since we were
	assuming things that does not hold true.  We were assuming that B0,
	B50 etc .. were ascending constant corresponding to 0, 1, etc ...
	This is not portable POSIX only says that cfgetispeed() return
	symbolic functions. To correct use approximatively the same code in
	telnet/sys_bsd.c.
