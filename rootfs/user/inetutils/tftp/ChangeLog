	* tftp/tftp.c: Checks for HAVE_DECL variables must read
	  #if !HAVE_DECL_something, since AC_CHECK_DECLS always
	  declares HAVE_DECL, either to 0 or to 1. 	  
	* tftpd/tftpd.c: Likewise.

2002-04-21  Alfred M. Szmidt <ams@kemisten.nu>

	* Makefile.am (inetdaemon_PROGRAMS): Use tftpd_BUILD instead of
	BUILD_TFTPD.
	* tftp.c [HAVE_STRERROR_DECL]: Renamed to HAVE_DECL_STRERROR.

	* Makefile.am: Add -I$(top_builddir)/include to INCLUDES

	There is a function sendfile() in the FreeBSD system headers, so:
	* tftp.c (sendfile): Rename to...
	(send_file): ... this.
	* main.c (put): Call send_file, not sendfile.
	* extern.h: Prototype send_file, not sendfile.

	* *: Clause 3 removed.
