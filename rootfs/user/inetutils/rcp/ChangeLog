	* rcp.c: Add support for rcp -V, Thanks to Chris Ulherr
	<chris.ulherr@inet.com> for reporting this.

2002-05-14  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>

	* rcp.c: Checks for HAVE_DECL variables must read
	  #if !HAVE_DECL_something, since AC_CHECK_DECLS always
	  declares HAVE_DECL, either to 0 or to 1.
	  (tolocal): Removed redefinitions of IP_TOS et al.

2002-04-21  Alfred M. Szmidt <ams@kemisten.nu>

	* Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS): Use rcp_BUILD instead of BUILD_RCP.
	* rcp.c [HAVE_STRERROR_DECL]: Renamed to HAVE_DECL_STRERROR.
